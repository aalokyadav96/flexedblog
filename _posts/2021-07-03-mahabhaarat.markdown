<p>
    Mahabharat was written as the mean of all the scriptures Indians had. Ganesh and Vedvyas wrote it as a poem so that people could easily memorize it and pass it on to the future generations, as printing was not durable. As time passed, Sankrit was forgotten. So, Mahabharat was translated to Hindi. But people added lot of fake stories and distorted the real content. Nowadays, Mahabharat has just become a book that tells about the biggest war.
